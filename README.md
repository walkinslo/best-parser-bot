## About
Okay, so I created this [bot](https://t.me/thebestrule34_bot) just to practice my Telegram API skills.


## Commands

- `/start` — Initial message.
- `/tag` — Initiate Rule34 mode (nsfw).
- `/help` — Commands.

## Deployment tutorial
1. Set the TELEGRAM_BOT_API env variable. Obtain the API key from the BotFather. 
2. Clone the repo.
3. `cd` into the cloned repo and launch `poetry install`.
4. Launch the bot by executing the `poetry run python -m bot` command.
